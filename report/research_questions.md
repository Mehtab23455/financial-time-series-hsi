# Research Questions

This study investigates the volatility dynamics of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) using daily data.

The primary research questions are:

1. Are daily log returns of the Hang Seng Index stationary?

2. Do HSI returns exhibit volatility clustering?

3. Is there statistical evidence of time-varying volatility (ARCH effects)?

4. Can a GARCH(1,1) model adequately capture the volatility dynamics of the HSI?

These questions guide the empirical analysis and model selection throughout the study.
