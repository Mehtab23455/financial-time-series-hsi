## Results and Findings

This study analyzed the volatility characteristics of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) using daily data and econometric time-series techniques.

## Price and Return Behavior

The Hang Seng Index price series exhibits strong non-stationarity and long-term trends. After transforming prices into log returns, the return series fluctuates around a zero mean, indicating stationarity.

## Volatility Clustering

Visual inspection of the return series and rolling volatility reveals pronounced volatility clustering. Periods of high volatility tend to follow one another, as do periods of low volatility.

## ARCH Effects

An ARCH-LM test strongly rejects the null hypothesis of constant variance, providing statistical evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity in HSI returns.

## GARCH Model Estimation

A GARCH(1,1) model is estimated to capture volatility dynamics. All parameters are statistically significant. The persistence parameter (α + β) is close to unity, indicating that volatility shocks decay slowly over time.

The estimated conditional volatility aligns closely with observed periods of market stress, confirming the model’s adequacy.
