# Volatility Dynamics of the Hang Seng Index

This repository presents a master’s-level empirical study of volatility behavior in the Hang Seng Index (HSI) using time series econometric techniques.

## Research Objective

The study investigates whether HSI returns exhibit volatility clustering and whether a GARCH framework can adequately model this behavior.

## Data

- Daily Hang Seng Index (^HSI)
- Source: Yahoo Finance
- Sample period: 2000–Present

## Methodology

- Log-return transformation
- Rolling volatility analysis
- ARCH-LM test for conditional heteroskedasticity
- GARCH(1,1) volatility modeling

## Key Findings

- Returns are stationary
- Strong volatility clustering is present
- ARCH effects are statistically significant
- GARCH(1,1) captures persistent volatility dynamics
